# 143Final-Project
Project by: Marcus Bolton, Michael Moffat, and Zach Casler

The goal of the game of Snake is about getting your snake as large as possible by consuming food and growing your tail.
Click the space bar to begin the game. Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake. If you run into a wall
that will result in game over and you will have the chance to restart and try again. If you run into yourself (any part
of your tail) this will also result in game over.

How to run program:
run the command "javac App.java && java App.java". Once the window opens up, first click the smaller white window, then
hit spacebar to begin the game. If you lose the game, hit spacebar again to reset and play again.
